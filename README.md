Predictive Analytics: Diabetes Classification

This project is an assignment as a completion for upskill program KYDP(K-Youth Development Programme). Case study as follow:
Health condition diagnosis is an essential and critical aspect for healthcare professionals. Classification of a diabetes type is one of the most complex phenomena for healthcare professionals and comprises several tests. However, analysing multiple factors at the time of diagnosis can sometimes lead to inaccurate results. Therefore, the interpretation and classification of diabetes are very challenging tasks. 
Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide healthcare crisis. It is caused due to the increased level of blood glucose. Generally, diabetics are classified as type 1 and type 2, and gestational diabetes. Presently with the ascent of machine learning, AI and neural systems and their application help the Medical domain enhance medical diagnosis dramatically. In this case study, you need to create an ML classification model that yields better results in identifying whether a person is diabetic or not.
